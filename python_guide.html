                        <p>This is a simple document to walk you through the installation of
                            <strong>python</strong>
                            and
                            <strong>ipython notebook</strong>
                            (one of the Integrated Development Environment IDE).</p>

                    <h2 class="w3-text-grey">Python 2 or Python 3?</h2>
                    <h4>
                        <p>In most of the case, no matter you are using mac, windows, or ubantu, one or more versions of python is pre-installed. Currently, there are two prevailing versions of python: python 2.X and 3.X. Python 3 is slightly newer but, python 2 could be
                            more stable and have more library support. Generally, python 2 is recommended for its stability and package avaialbility. And I, the GSI, am more familiar with python 2 than python 3.
                        </p>
                        <p>The syntax of them are almost identical with only a few exceptions. A comparison between them can be found
                            <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3">here</a>. Most packages that are going to be used in this class, such as
                            <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">sklearn</a>, are supported by both python 2 and python 3. As mentioned in class, we will try to accommodate both versions.
                        </p>

        <ol><li><p>In mac, you can simply start a terminal and type: ($ is already there so you do not need to type it) <br>
        <code>$ python</code></p></li>
        <li><p>In windows, this is usually hard since the path to python is usually not automatically set. Check <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4621255/how-do-i-run-a-python-program-in-the-command-prompt-in-windows-7">it</a> out if you really want to do it in windows.</p></li></ol></li> -->

                                    </br>
                                    IDEs allow you to write script and run it, see the result simultaneously! ipython notebook is one of the leading IDE for python. I personally like it most comparing to several IDEs including pycharm and spider because of the simplicity of use and
                                    clarity of the outputs. You could explore more about ipython notebook here
                                    <a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html">here</a>.</p>

                                    <b>Use text editors : the expert way.</b>
                                </br>
                                Code in any text editors and use bash shell to run python script. There are some good choises of text universal editors, such as
                                <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>
                                and
                                <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime</a>. Check this
                                <a href="http://pythoncentral.io/execute-python-script-file-shell/">article</a>
                                out about on how to run your python scripts. Text editors are smoother in text editing due to their light weights and highly customizable for different languages. This approach is also useful when you need to run something remotely on the server
                                where only a shell (but no GUI) is available to you.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    Some personal experience: I use text editors to write python scripts. I will run the scripts using ipython notebook if I would like to store and document the outputs, especially the plots.

                    <p>No matter if you have a python or not in your computer, you can install python and ipython notebook, as well as other dependencies and packages through Anaconda.
                    </p>

                    <p>The installation is pretty easy on all operating systems, check this page out:

                    </p>

                    <p>After having it installed, you are ready to run python through ipython notebook. Just start a bash shell in terminal (mac) or a cmd window (windows). Type:</p>

                    <pre><code>$ ipython notebook</code></pre>

                    <p>If you see a new tab appearing in your browser, you are all set! If not, paste the error message to google and search how other people solved it. If no satisfactory answer is found, paste your error message and a screenshot to Piazza. We will help
                        you!</p>

                        <b>Matplotlib</b>
                        is one of the most powerful visualiztion library in python. You can find sample plots and code
